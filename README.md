# pokerust

Hey it's (another) pokedex running in your terminal! Built in Rust.

![Quick Demo](/docs/demo.gif "Logo Title Text 1")

## Motivation and general info

I am excited about Rust and in love with Pokemon franchise. So I summed up two plus two and decided that it will be great to make Pokedex as a practice pet project. I tried to keep my code as clean as possible, but due to my little knowledge of Rust and it's best practices there might be some inconsistencies and stuff.

Feel free to add issues and maybe contribute!
